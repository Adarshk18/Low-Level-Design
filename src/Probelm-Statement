Live Streaming System Design
Core Requirements:

Stream live video to millions of users.

Handle comments, reactions, and advertisements.

Ensure high availability and performance.

Key Components:

Video Transformation: Convert raw video into multiple resolutions (e.g., 480p, 720p, 1080p) using a MapReduce pattern.

Video Delivery: Use adaptive streaming protocols (e.g., HLS, DASH) to adjust video quality based on user bandwidth.

Database: Store video metadata in SQL databases and video files in distributed file systems (e.g., S3).

Caching: Cache frequently accessed video segments to reduce latency.

APIs:

getVideoFrame: Fetch video frames based on timestamp and device type.

postComment: Allow users to post comments on videos.

5. Low-Level Design (LLD)
Focus: Detailed implementation of specific components (e.g., video playback, comment handling).

Use Case Diagrams:

Define user actions (e.g., play video, pause, seek).

Map actions to system behaviors (e.g., fetch video frames, store comments).

Class Diagrams:

Define classes (e.g., Video, User, WatchedVideo) with states (data) and behaviors (methods).

Example: Video class stores frames and metadata, with a method to retrieve frames by timestamp.

Sequence Diagrams:

Show interactions between components (e.g., user requests video → server fetches frame → returns to user).

Optimize for performance (e.g., reduce network calls by caching).

6. Coding the System
Video Class:

Stores video frames, metadata, and methods to retrieve frames by timestamp.

Example: getFrame(timestamp) returns the frame corresponding to the requested time.

User Class:

Stores user details (e.g., ID, name, email).

WatchedVideo Class:

Tracks user interactions (e.g., video ID, user ID, seek timestamp).

VideoConsumingService Class:

Handles API requests (e.g., getSeekTime, getFrame).

Interacts with databases and file systems to fetch data.

7. Testing and Optimization
Load Testing: Simulate high traffic to ensure the system can handle peak loads.

Edge Cases: Test for unusual scenarios (e.g., network failures, invalid inputs).

Performance Optimization:

Use CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) to distribute static content.

Implement caching to reduce database load.

8. Tools and Protocols
Network Protocols:

HTTP/HTTPS: Stateless protocol for general API communication.

WebRTC: Peer-to-peer protocol for real-time video streaming.

HLS/DASH: Adaptive streaming protocols for video delivery.

Database Solutions:

SQL: For structured data (e.g., user profiles, comments).

NoSQL: For scalable, unstructured data (e.g., video metadata).

File Systems: For storing large files (e.g., S3, HDFS).

9. Key Takeaways
System design involves converting business requirements into scalable, reliable, and maintainable technical solutions.

Design patterns (e.g., Publisher-Subscriber, MapReduce) provide reusable solutions to common problems.

Low-level design focuses on detailed implementation, including class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and coding.

Testing and optimization are critical to ensure system performance and reliability.
